# CitiBike Venture Analysis

The purpose of this analysis is to gain insights from the CitiBike business in order to have an understanding of whether or not it is an attractive business to invest.

## Overview of Approach

Using Tableau we analyzed one month data from the CitiBike operation in the city of New York.  The month analyzed is August due to the good weather conditions.
Some external data from research such as price of rides and cost of mainteinance of bikes was included in the analysis.

The dataset contains 2,343,746 rows that correspond to rides.  One of the columns of the dataset, tripduration, was converted to Datetime data type using Python.  We can see the result of the conversion in the following image:
