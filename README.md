Some external data from research such as price of rides and cost of mainteinance of bikes was included in the analysis.

The dataset contains 2,343,746 rows that correspond to rides.  One of the columns of the dataset, tripduration, was converted to Datetime data type using Python.  We can see the result of the conversion in the following image:

## Analysis


### Revenue

* There are two types of users: occassional customers and subscribers.  Customers represent the 19% and Subscribers represent the 81% from the total rides.  
* The vast majority of rides in both groups were in between 0-30 minutes. 
* A small portion of the revenue was calculated for customers.  We multiplied the number of 0-30-minute rides for customers times $3.5, which is the price published on the CitiBike's website.
* It is necessary to get more data to understand how many unique subscribers rode in August and be able to calculate the accrued revenue for those using the monthly subscription price.
